Hello! I'm Aliah Zewail, an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and PhD student in Social Psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I work with Dr. Mohammad Atari in the Culture and Morality Lab. My research rests on the intersection of moral psychology, cultural evolution, and computational social science. Specifically, I study the historical origins of cultural and moral attributions, how they change across time and space, and their impact on societal institutions and collective behaviors. My work integrates psychometrics, econometrics, and computational methods to pursue these questions.

My research has appeared in leading jounrlas in psychology and the behavioral sciecnes, including _Psychological Science_ and _European Review of Social Psychology_ and has been presented at major academic conerences, Society of Personality and Social Psychology and Association for the Study of Religion and Culture.

Prior to beginning my doctoral studies, I earned my BA in Psychology (with a minor in French) from the University of Texas at Austin, where I worked in the Pennebaker lab on the 2022 edition of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool.

When I am not in my office glued to my computer, you can find me homebrewing, playing with my cat, rehearsing with a local orchestra, or offering unsolicitated literary commentary on books I think are transformative. 

I am always happy to connect -- whether it be about research, NSF applications, Whether it be about NSF GRFP applications, PhD applications, goodreads, practice french, or if you want to exchange reciepe and cat photos, my email address is always open. please email me at azewail[at]umass[dot]edu :-)
